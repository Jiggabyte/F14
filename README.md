A javascript game for phonegap build.

The game was not build by me, it is a browser I want to bring to mobile touchscreen phones.

Clone repository on local machine to play it locally with your browser both normal screens and touch screens
or still compress after cloning into a zip and then build on phonegap to get android, ios and/or windows app to play with mobile.
